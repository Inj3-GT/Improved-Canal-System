# Improved-Canal-System
Garry's Mod / Inj3 - Improved Canal System

- Voice system, players on channel A can't hear those on channel B, players on the same channel can hear each other regardless of distance (proximity voice is always active, so if you speak via your microphone, players in the perimeter will hear you) !
- Channel locking system: if an administrator is present in a locked channel, it will remain closed. If a player is not present or has no permission, it will open automatically. Privileged ranks (represented by a star) can bypass and join locked channels! Locked channels - Cannot be accessed by a group without privilege, or a job without privilege.
- Restriction bypass system, a superadmin or specific job can access a channel that is full or locked.
- Scrollbar to prevent panels leaving the screen and becoming inaccessible or reducing visibility on your screen.
- Some information is hidden (micro-active, rank icon, group exclusion icon) if you're in a different channel.
- Permission system with rank and profession (via configuration).
- System to hide/display/move channels in header.
- You can fully activate/deactivate players transmitting from the channel, or deactivate your microphone's transmission to players in your channel.
- Players marked with a star have channel permissions
